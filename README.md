Using https://openweathermap.org APIS and Twilio created a program that can send automatic text messages if will rain.

Depending on the weather forcast, this will send a text message to a valided number on Twilio.

In order to have the program runn daily, you will need to create an account on  https://www.pythonanywhere.com and host the code there(eg. Here you can schedule it to run every moring on 7AM)

Thake into consideration that you can use Twilio and Pythonanyware with some limitations with free accounts.

IMPORTNAT NOTE:  

1. api_key/token and sid are saved using environment variables for security purposes if needed (eg. when posting on pythonaywhere.com)

2. If you are running the code for your eyes only, you can add as strings the api_key/token and sid.

Enjoy!
